# OSC Tools
# by Christiane Ruetten, cr at 23bit.net

Just a bunch of undocumented tools converting input into OSC packets,
written for the GPN11 Fluxus visuals live coding performance.

So far we have:

 osc_midibeat.py - detects and streams Traktor beat sync messages

 osc_accel.py - queries and streams OpenChronos acceleration sensor data

 bm.py - early audio signal processing tests aimed towards beatmatching
